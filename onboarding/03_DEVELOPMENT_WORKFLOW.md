# 🔄 Development Workflow Guide

This guide explains the different development modes and workflows for the Polka project.

## 🎯 Development Modes Overview

The Polka project supports multiple development modes, each optimized for different types of work:

| Mode | Command | Best For | Speed | Features |
|------|---------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Web Development** | `npm run dev` | UI Components, Styling | ⚡ Fast | Hot reload, Browser dev tools |
| **Desktop Development** | `npm run tauri dev` | Full App Testing | 🐌 Slower | Native features, Database, File system |
| **Production Build** | `npm run build` | Testing Builds | 🚀 Fast | Production-like environment |
| **Desktop Build** | `npm run tauri build` | Distribution | 🐌 Slow | Installable desktop app |

## 🖥️ Web Development Mode (`npm run dev`)

### When to Use
- **UI Component Development**: Building and styling React components
- **Layout Work**: Adjusting page layouts and responsive design
- **State Management**: Testing Zustand stores and React hooks
- **Quick Iterations**: When you need fast feedback on UI changes
- **Debugging CSS**: Using browser dev tools for styling issues

### What You Get
- ✅ **Fast Hot Reload**: Changes appear instantly in browser
- ✅ **Browser Dev Tools**: Full access to React DevTools, Network tab, etc.
- ✅ **Responsive Testing**: Easy testing across different screen sizes
- ✅ **Console Logging**: Full browser console access
- ✅ **Network Inspection**: See API calls and network requests

### What You Don't Get
- ❌ **Native Features**: No database access, file system, etc.
- ❌ **Tauri APIs**: `@tauri-apps/api` calls won't work
- ❌ **Desktop Integration**: No system tray, native menus, etc.

### Workflow Example
```bash
# Start web development
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:1420
# Make changes to components
# See changes instantly in browser
# Use React DevTools for debugging
```

## 🖥️ Desktop Development Mode (`npm run tauri dev`)

### When to Use
- **Full App Testing**: Testing complete application functionality
- **Database Operations**: Working with SQLite database
- **File System Access**: Testing file operations and storage
- **Native Features**: Testing Tauri plugins and system integration
- **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete user workflows
- **Performance Testing**: Testing app performance in desktop environment

### What You Get
- ✅ **Complete Functionality**: All features work as in production
- ✅ **Native APIs**: Full access to Tauri APIs and plugins
- ✅ **Database Access**: SQLite database operations work
- ✅ **File System**: Read/write access to local files
- ✅ **System Integration**: Native menus, system tray, etc.
- ✅ **Real Performance**: Actual desktop app performance

### What You Don't Get
- ❌ **Fast Iteration**: Slower build times (Rust compilation)
- ❌ **Browser Dev Tools**: Limited debugging capabilities
- ❌ **Hot Reload**: May need to restart for some changes

### Workflow Example
```bash
# Start desktop development
npm run tauri dev

# Desktop app window opens
# Test authentication flow
# Test database operations
# Test file system access
# Test complete user workflows
```

## 🔄 Hybrid Development Workflow

### Recommended Approach
Use a **hybrid approach** that combines both modes for optimal productivity:

### Phase 1: UI Development (Web Mode)
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Build and style components
- Implement layouts and responsive design
- Test React state management
- Use browser dev tools for debugging

### Phase 2: Integration Testing (Desktop Mode)
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```
- Test native features integration
- Verify database operations
- Test complete user flows
- Performance testing

### Phase 3: Iteration (Back to Web Mode)
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Quick fixes and improvements
- Additional UI refinements
- State management adjustments

## 🧪 Testing Strategies

### Frontend Testing (Web Mode)
```bash
npm run dev
```
**Test in browser:**
- Component rendering
- State changes
- User interactions
- Responsive design
- Accessibility features

### Integration Testing (Desktop Mode)
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```
**Test in desktop app:**
- Authentication flows
- Database operations
- File system access
- Native plugin functionality
- Complete user journeys

### Build Testing
```bash
# Test web build
npm run build
npm run preview

# Test desktop build
npm run tauri build
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

### Web Mode Optimizations
- Use React DevTools Profiler
- Monitor bundle size with Vite
- Test with different screen sizes
- Use browser performance tools

### Desktop Mode Optimizations
- Monitor memory usage
- Test with large datasets
- Profile database queries
- Test startup time

## 🔍 Debugging Strategies

### Web Mode Debugging
```bash
npm run dev
```
- **React DevTools**: Component tree, props, state
- **Browser Console**: JavaScript errors, logs
- **Network Tab**: API calls, performance
- **Elements Tab**: DOM inspection, CSS debugging

### Desktop Mode Debugging
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```
- **Tauri Logs**: Native backend logs
- **Database Inspection**: SQLite browser tools
- **System Monitoring**: Activity Monitor, Task Manager
- **File System**: Check file operations

## 📱 Responsive Development

### Web Mode (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Use browser dev tools device simulation
- Test across different screen sizes
- Use responsive design tools
- Quick iteration for mobile layouts

### Desktop Mode
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```
- Test actual window resizing
- Verify native responsive behavior
- Test system integration at different sizes

## 🔄 Switching Between Modes

### Quick Mode Switch
```bash
# Stop current mode (Ctrl+C)
# Switch to web mode
npm run dev

# Switch to desktop mode
npm run tauri dev
```

### Preserving State
- **Web Mode**: Browser preserves state between sessions
- **Desktop Mode**: App state persists between restarts
- **Database**: Data persists across mode switches

## 📊 Development Metrics

### Web Mode Metrics
- **Build Time**: ~1-3 seconds
- **Hot Reload**: <1 second
- **Memory Usage**: Browser-based
- **CPU Usage**: Browser-based

### Desktop Mode Metrics
- **Build Time**: ~10-30 seconds
- **Hot Reload**: N/A (may need restart)
- **Memory Usage**: Native app usage
- **CPU Usage**: Native app usage

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. **Start with Web Mode**
- Begin UI development in web mode
- Use fast iteration for component building
- Leverage browser dev tools

### 2. **Test in Desktop Mode**
- Switch to desktop mode for integration testing
- Verify native features work correctly
- Test complete user workflows

### 3. **Iterate Efficiently**
- Use web mode for quick fixes
- Use desktop mode for thorough testing
- Balance speed vs. completeness

### 4. **Monitor Performance**
- Track build times
- Monitor app performance
- Profile database operations
- Test with realistic data
